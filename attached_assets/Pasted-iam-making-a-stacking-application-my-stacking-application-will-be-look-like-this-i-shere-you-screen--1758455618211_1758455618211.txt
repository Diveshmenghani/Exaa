Gen Z Design Principles üöÄ Unique Layouts: Embrace overlapping elements, unique typography, and varied section heights that don't adhere to traditional web design norms.
Expressive Interactions: Incorporate unexpected hover effects and animations, such as images blocked by hover cards or elements connected by sticky notes.

Functionality & Visuals: Present familiar functionalities in visually novel ways, like floating buttons for case studies.

Non-Traditional Footer: Consider a footer design that is unique and expressive, potentially resembling a table of contents.

Full-Screen Video Integration üé¨ Engaging Visuals: Utilize high-quality, full-screen videos for hero sections and throughout the website to immediately capture user attention and showcase work.

Dynamic Transitions: Implement page transitions where backgrounds change while central text remains fixed, or image swaps linked to scroll actions.

Immersive 3D Elements üßä Interactive 3D: Integrate 3D elements that are connected to scroll events, creating a sense of state-of-the-art technology.
Creative Placement: Experiment with novel ways to utilize 3D elements within a 2D browser space, such as orbiting case studies around a 3D cube.

Animated Interactions: Add interactive 3D animations, like team members dancing on hover in the footer.

Stylized Graphics & Transitions: Incorporate stylized 3D graphics (e.g., a 3D Game Boy) and cool 3D page transitions that skew or zoom.

The goal is to create a website that is not only visually striking but also offers a highly engaging and memorable user experience through innovative design and interaction.
